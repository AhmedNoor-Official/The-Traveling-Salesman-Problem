# The-Traveling-Salesman-Problem

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP): 

Basically is, given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, 
what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the original city? 

This Program is capable of: 
1. Randomly generating a map of locations 
2. Calculating the distance between those locations 
3. Generating a visiting order to find the shortest path 
4. Visualising the path.
